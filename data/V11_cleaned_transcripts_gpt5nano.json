Vital signs are stable: blood pressure 113/60, heart rate 113, respiratory rate 18 non-labored, SpO2 100% on room air. The mother is not with us and will meet from work. The patient did not wear a helmet. Pupils are pearl. The estimated speed of the vehicle was about 25 mph. Mechanism of injury: bicycle versus car; rider struck while crossing the roadway; vehicle traveling approximately 25 mph; no helmet. The patient remains stable with mild knee pain and knee road rash; GCS 15.",

Extrication time was reported as approximately 15 to 20 minutes, with later notes of 20 to 30 minutes. She has abrasions over her body. There is concern for a skull fracture across the nasal bridge; the nose appears depressed between the eyes and the eyes are slightly bulged. She was found without pulses; ROSC occurred after about three minutes of CPR performed by firefighters. No epinephrine was given; CPR alone. She was intubated with an endotracheal tube size 6 and two IV lines were in place. A 150 mL bolus of normal saline had been given and fluids are running. On arrival, heart rate is 172 bpm and blood pressure is 129/66 mmHg. SpO2 is 100% with ETCO2 35\u201336 mmHg. She has agonal respirations with bagging, approximately four breaths per minute. Active bleeding is from the left nostril. Blood was seen in the back of the throat at intubation. A halo test was performed on the nasal bleed to evaluate for CSF, though the result is unclear. Pupils were initially fixed and dilated but are now mildly reactive and beginning to constrict with light. GCS was 3 on arrival. Skin is pale with slight mottling. There are no other obvious deformities aside from scrapes and abrasions. She is currently about 10 to 15 minutes from Grand Island.

The patient is intubated with a size 3.0 endotracheal tube positioned at depth 11 cm; the tube placement is reported to look good. A chest X-ray is being obtained to confirm. There are bilateral breath sounds. On arrival the patient was bagged, and the ventilator is set to PEEP 5 cm H2O, rate 30 breaths per minute, tidal volume 45, FiO2 40 percent. A staff member asked what was set, and the response was PEEP 5, rate 30, tidal volume 45, FiO2 40 percent; a note indicated that the number 100 may have been used, but its meaning is unclear. Vitals: blood pressure 101/51, heart rate 135, respiratory rate 30. The patient has been given PRN fentanyl for sedation and is minimally responsive to pain. Pupils are pinpoint; the fontanelle feels a little full. Head CT shows bilateral intracranial hemorrhages; other imaging reported as normal. No seizure prophylaxis has been given yet. The team plans to administer levetiracetam at 60 mg/kg. An initial ABG was described with CO2 50, potassium 7.8, and glucose 54; pH and other ABG values were not clearly stated. A repeat ABG was described as the new gas with CO2 reported as 7.20, which is unclear. Lab results include sodium 139, potassium 4.4, ionized calcium 5.8, glucose 63, hemoglobin 8.8, hematocrit 26; base excess negative with bicarbonate 22.4; O2 saturation 80 percent. The team intends to move immediately and start D10F maintenance in route. They would like to obtain the prior imaging to avoid repeating studies; imaging is available. ETA back to hospital is about 25 minutes, with the flight back quoted as 15 minutes and total under 30.",

The father is present and videotaped the collision; there was a momentary loss of consciousness. Lung fields are clear. No crepitus or deformity in the neck noted when the collar was applied. He is fully immobilized with a cervical collar and backboard. IVs established. ETA to receiving facility is 10\u201312 minutes. GCS 15 throughout the encounter.

The patient is a five-year-old male, described by his mother. He was reportedly climbing a tree and fell from an approximate height of at least eight feet onto a cement paver at the base of the tree. There was no reported loss of consciousness. He was initially awake and crying and was found by his family. He has intermittent periods of decreased responsiveness; when he regains consciousness he is oriented, but then his level of consciousness decreases again. His heart rate has varied from 80 to 120 beats per minute depending on whether he is crying or calm. His blood pressure is 136/86 mmHg. His oxygen saturation is 98% on two liters of oxygen by nasal cannula, and his end-tidal CO2 is between 38 and 44. A blood glucose was not obtained; I do not believe hypoglycemia is an issue. IV access was not obtained; attempts have not been made further as our priority has been to keep him calm during transport. The referring facility reportedly performed a chest X-ray, and no other imaging has been completed prior to transport. Current GCS is 13\u201315 when awake; during transient decreases in consciousness it may be 11\u201312. Estimated arrival time to the hospital is approximately eight minutes.

The child currently has abdominal (belly) pain, is crying, and holding his abdomen; there are no reported losses of consciousness in either patient, and the child woke crying immediately after the crash. The mother reports shoulder pain from the seat belt but otherwise appears well, with no loss of consciousness. There were no obvious external injuries noted by EMS. The last-vitals available in the field include a respiratory rate of approximately 22 breaths per minute for the child; heart rate and blood pressure were not documented. The EMS team discussed whether to activate trauma for the child given abdominal pain but plan to evaluate here first and decide. They prefer to keep the mother with the child to avoid separation. The mother would be evaluated here with stabilization and then potentially transferred if needed (likely ECMC vs Buffalo General, depending on trauma designation). The EMS team will arrange the child\u2019s evaluation here and coordinate transfer if needed, and will call with ETA and updated vitals to confirm trauma activation status as transport progresses. The paramedics indicated they would try to arrange two days of observation for the child. I will provide updates as vitals and disposition evolve.",

The patient is awake and acting normally, moving all extremities, with pupils brisk to light. An IV was established and glucose measured at 92 mg/dL. There was an order for ceftriaxone because she was treated as septic. There was discussion about initiating Augmentin for dog bite coverage. The plan discussed was to give ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV now, followed by Augmentin per weight at 50 mg/kg. The neck was immobilized with an improvised collar using a towel, and she is being kept in isolation with temperature maintenance. The injuries are primarily superficial, though there is significant scalp and bilateral temporal ecchymosis and left-ear bleeding. ENT or facial involvement was considered but not clearly required at this time given the superficial nature of the injuries.

He has not vomited since EMS arrived. There is nothing to give for pain at this time, as I am an advanced EMT. I considered starting a saline IV bolus pending your approval.

We decided to perform rapid sequence intubation on scene. I am at Coudersport and about 40 to 45 minutes out. Blood pressure is 129/75. The patient is 100% on the ventilator. Tidal volume is 36 mL with the endotracheal tube in place. Endotracheal tube size is 6.0, at 20 cm at the lip. I have bilateral IV access. She has received approximately 200 mL of fluids. Current medications on board include 60 of rock, 20 of etomidate, plus 50 of scent for post sedation. I plan to give another 50 and then boluses of 50 every 15 to 20 minutes in flight. The patient is stable. Prior to this tube, she was acting erratically; she fell from her bike, lost consciousness for a minute or greater, woke and was acting completely outside of herself, attempting to ride away on her bike. She has a significant hematoma to the back of her head that is increasing in size. Pupils look okay right now. She is tolerating the tube well, but she previously closed her eyes and would respond to painful stimuli, then not respond at all, then respond, and then pull everything off, tucking her arms up under her chin, indicating abnormal behavior. Mom was significantly concerned with these behaviors, suggesting it may be more than a teenage behavioral issue. She never answered questions or followed commands, but she is already two, so that part's done for you. GCS is estimated around 6 to 7, best around 6 to 7, worst around 3. Heart rate is 99 bpm. SpO2 is 100% on the vent. Last BP noted was 127 to Salix. She has not been off Vitalize at all. We already chatted with Kunal, so he\u2019s on board as well.
